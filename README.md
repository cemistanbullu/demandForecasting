###### Description: This project is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. We tried to solve the time series problem with light gbm, one of the machine learning algorithms. 

##### Aim:
- We have a list of different products that stores sell over a period of 5 years.
- Our aim is to estimate which product and how much weight should be given with minimum error.
- Unlike time series algorithms with a practical feature engineering method, I developed artificial intelligence with light gbm.

###### This problem is based on a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only you can find the datasets right there.
